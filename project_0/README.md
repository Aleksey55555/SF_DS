### Description
Guess the number in the minimum number of attempts


### Case
Need to write a script which guess the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Conditions**
- Computer guesses a random integer from 0 to 100. We need to write a script which guess the number in the minimum number of attempts.
- The algorithm gets information about whether the predicted number was higher or lower than the guessed number.

**Quality metric**
Results are evaluated by the average number of attempts per 1000 replays

**What we are practicing**
To write a good script in Python


### Data information 
...


### Stages of project
1. To write script for an algorithm of guessing number with manual input.
2. To write script for an algorithm of guessing number in the minimum number of attempts by compueter.
3. To write script for an algorithm for calculating a mean number of attempts of guess number algorithm per 1000 attempts.
4. Post it in https://github.com/


### Result
[1. Script of the algorithm of guessing number with manual input](https://github.com/Aleksey55555/SF_DS/blob/main/project_0/game.py)

[2. Script for an algorithm of guessing number by compueter](https://github.com/Aleksey55555/SF_DS/blob/main/project_0/game_V2.py)

[3. Script for an algorithm for calculating a mean number of attempts of guess number algorithm per 1000 attempts](https://github.com/Aleksey55555/SF_DS/blob/main/project_0/game_V2.py)

### Conclusion
I wrote script in Python in VS Code and posted results in https://github.com/.
